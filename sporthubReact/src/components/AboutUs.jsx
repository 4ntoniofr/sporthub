            Team
          </h2>
          <p>
            We are a group of five Software Engineering students who are currently in our third year of studies.
            We are taking the User Interfaces subject, and as part of the course requirements, we have decided to
            create an e-commerce platform called SportHub. Our goal is to create an accessible and functional online
            store for sports enthusiasts that offers a wide range of high-quality products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team consists of five highly motivated individuals who are all committed to making SportHub a success.
            Our team members are Jorge, Valent√≠n, Antonio, Pepe, and Pablo. We all come from different backgrounds and have different
            skill sets, which allows us to work together effectively and bring a unique perspective to the table.

            Technologies
          </h2>
          <p>
            We decided to use React and SQLite3 as our primary technologies for this project. React is a popular JavaScript
            library for building user interfaces, while SQLite3 is a lightweight database management system that is ideal for
            small-scale projects. By using these technologies, we were able to create a platform that is both responsive and efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we are committed to making SportHub the best possible platform for our users. We are excited to
            continue developing and improving our platform, and we hope that you will join us on this journey.
